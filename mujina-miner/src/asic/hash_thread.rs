//! HashThread abstraction for schedulable mining workers.
//!
//! A HashThread represents a schedulable group of hashing engines that work
//! together to execute mining tasks. The scheduler assigns work to HashThreads
//! without needing to know about the underlying hardware topology (single chip,
//! chip chain, engine groups, etc.).
//!
//! # Share Processing (Three-Layer Filtering)
//!
//! Share filtering happens at three independent levels:
//!
//! 1. **Chip TicketMask (hardware pre-filter):**
//!    Thread configures chip with low difficulty for frequent health signals.
//!    Chip only reports nonces meeting this hardware threshold.
//!
//! 2. **HashTask.share_target (thread-to-scheduler filter):**
//!    Scheduler sets when assigning work. Thread computes hash for every chip
//!    nonce and sends shares meeting task.share_target via the task's channel.
//!    Controls message volume to scheduler.
//!
//! 3. **JobTemplate.share_target (scheduler-to-source filter):**
//!    Scheduler performs final filtering before submission. Only shares
//!    meeting this threshold are forwarded to the source.
//!
//! This provides scheduler with frequent monitoring data (task.share_target)
//! while limiting pool submissions (template.share_target). Message volume
//! is manageable: ~1-2 shares/sec to scheduler, fewer to pool.
