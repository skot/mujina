//! The scheduler module manages the distribution of mining jobs to hash boards
//! and ASIC chips.
//!
//! # Share Filtering (Three-Layer Architecture)
//!
//! Share filtering happens at three independent levels:
//!
//! **Layer 1 - Chip TicketMask (hardware pre-filter):**
//! - Configured by thread during initialization
//! - Chip only reports nonces meeting this threshold
//! - Set for frequent health signals (~1/sec at current hashrate)
//!
//! **Layer 2 - HashTask.share_target (scheduler target, per-thread):**
//! - Computed per thread from that thread's hashrate
//! - Clamps source difficulty between a measurement floor (1
//!   share/sec) and a flood ceiling (10 shares/sec)
//! - Feeds per-thread hashrate estimators with frequent samples
//! - Decoupled from pool difficulty so measurement works even
//!   when pool difficulty is very high
//!
//! **Layer 3 - JobTemplate.share_target (scheduler-to-source filter):**
//! - Set by pool via Stratum mining.set_difficulty
//! - Scheduler validates before forwarding to source
//! - Only pool-worthy shares submitted
//!
//! The scheduler receives shares meeting HashTask.share_target, uses them for
//! statistics and monitoring, then filters again before pool submission. This
//! provides accurate per-thread metrics while controlling network traffic.
//!
//! This is a work-in-progress. It's currently the main and initial place where
//! functionality is added, after which the functionality is refactored out to
//! where it belongs.
